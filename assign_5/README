####################################### Network traffic monitoring using the Packet Capture library #############################################


Options: -i ,-r ,-f,-h

-i : Monitor the traffic live from a network interface (pcap_open_live).
-r: Read a pcap file (pcap_open_offline).
-f : filter expression.
-h : help message.

Instructions for running:

Step I)  run "make" to create the executable pcap_ex.

Step II) Available combos:

1) sudo ./pcap_ex -i    ( monitor traffic live without filter!)

Then a list of the available devices will appear,type one and press enter.

2) sudo ./pcap_ex -i -f "port 8080" (monitor traffic live with filter expression!)

Then a list with the available devices will appear to choose one 

The output will appear at the file "log.txt".

**DONT Forget "sudo", otherwise there are problems with socket permissions.**
**Enter the filter as an command line argument!!! ** 

*** IMPORTANT NOTE: after every run, the file "log.txt" is on append mode.
run "make clean" to clean the file every time you run the program. ***


3) sudo ./pcap_ex -r ( read a pcap file offline).

Then you have to enter a pcap file ( test_pcap_5mins.pcap) and press enter.

The output will appear at the terminal.
