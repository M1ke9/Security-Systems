###################Assignement 3 - Enhanced Access Control Logging System########################

I) STEP 1-logger.c

-Developed functions fopen and fwrite for the logging file ( file_logging.log)

-Each log entry contains the following information :

1)UID (unique user ID) (getuid() )

2)File name

3)Date of the action occured

4)Timestamp of the action occured

5)Access type with access types 0,1 and 2 for file creation,file open and file write.

6)Is_action_denied flag (if denied =1 , otherwise 0).

7)File Fingerprint --->getFingerprint by md5 hash functions



*Note: at the meanwhile I inported the rsa.c and rsa.h files ( makefile completed)  but i had not time to think how to make it works in this assignment. 


II) STEP 2-acmonitor.c

1) list_unauthorized_accesses ---> prints all the malicious users( access to more than 7 files with no permisssion).

2) list_file_modifications ---> a table with numbers of times each user modified the file.
